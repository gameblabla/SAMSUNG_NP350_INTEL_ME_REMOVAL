Hello,

this is for the Samsung NP350E7C with a Pentium B980.
This laptop will spew an error if you try to upgrade the processor.
Tried to upgrade the ME but this results in a failure.

Even if you disable the Intel ME, it will still shut itself down due to the incompatibilty.

I also modified the VBIOS and overclocked the 7670M from 600/900 to 780/1135.

My laptop froze during the erase flashing... so welp.

I bought a SOIC8 clip to flash this chip so hopefully, i can unbrick it.
I also have another identical laptop like that so if my dump doesn't work, then i can just take it from this one.
See you in 18 more days. (Written the 4th September 2020)
